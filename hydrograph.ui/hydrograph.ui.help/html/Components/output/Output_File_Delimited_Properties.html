<p><span class="header-1">Output File Delimited Properties</span></p>

<p><span><b>Properties</b>&nbsp;for the Output File Delimited component can be viewed by Double click-&gt;component on canvas. The properties contain a &#39;General&#39; tab and a &#39;Schema&#39; tab. Common and mandatory properties are present in the General tab. Schema displays option to accept the field schema i.e. field name, Data type, scale etc. </span></p>

<p><span class="header-2">Display</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span><b>Name</b> - The Name field will specify the name of the component as desired by the user.</span></li>
		<li><span><b>ID</b> - ID field will specify unique id for every component. </span></li>
	<li><span><b>Type </b> - Type further categorizes the component to detailed operation that it intends to perform. Here it is of type Output File Delimited.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><b>Configuration</b></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><b>File Path</b> - File path is used to specify the path where the Output delimited file will be generated after successful execution . User can either manually type the path in the text box provided or use the Browse button to search for a location to save the output file. Alternatively, the user can parameterize the File path where the parameter value will be resolved at run-time.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Delimiter</b> - The Delimiter field accepts the delimiter that will be used in the created Output file. By default the delimiter passed to this component is &#39;|&#39;</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Overwrite</b> - This property accepts Boolean values True and False. It can also be parameterized and later on resolved during run-time. The Overwrite property when True, overwrites the output file.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Safe Property</b> - This property accepts Boolean values True and False. It can also be parameterized and later on resolved during run-time. The Safe property when True, allows the Output fields to pass evaluation despite of Data type mismatch. When False, fields with Data type mismatch will be rejected and the component will abort processing returning an error.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Has Header</b> - This property accepts Boolean values True and False. It can also be parameterized and later on resolved during run-time. Has Header is simply used to signify whether an Output file will contain a header or not. When True, component assumes the first row of the file to be the header. Reverse in case of False.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Character Set</b> - Contains a drop-down of character encoding values. Used simply to denote the encoding system that will be used while creating the Output file to denote characters of data. Drop down lists values like : UTF8, US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1 etc.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Strict</b> - Strict accepts&nbsp;Boolean values True and False. It can also be parameterized and later on resolved during run-time. Strict property is used to check if the record structure i.e. number of fields, length of records, scale etc are exactly listed by the user as received from the Output file. When set to True, the component fails if the record structure doesn&#39;t match with the one specified by the user. Reverse in case of False.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Runtime Properties</b> -&nbsp;Runtime properties are used to override the Hadoop configurations specific to Output File Delimited component at run time. User is required to enter the Property Name and Value in the runtime properties grid.</span></li>
	<p><span>Check <a href="../../How To Steps/How_To_Pass_Hadoop_Properties_To_Component.html"> How to pass Hadoop properties to component</a></span></p></li>
	<p><img alt="" src="../../images/Runtime_Properties_Grid.png" /></p>
	<li><span><b>Batch</b> - Batch simply accepts a numeric value starting from 0 to maximum 99 and signifies the batch this component will execute in. By default this is 0.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="header-2">Schema tab:</span></p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../images/Output_File_Delimited_Properties_Schema.png" /></p>
<p><span><b>Schema Types</b></span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span><b>Internal</b> - User is provided a Grid to enter the internal schema of the Output Delimited file.</span></span></li>
	<ul><li><span><b>Field Name</b> - User needs to enter all the Field names in this column.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><b>Data type</b> - By default "string" Data type has been selected for any field added to the Grid. User can select from different Data type values like "integer", "double", "float" etc.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Date Format</b> - User can specify desired date format like "YY-DD-MM", "YYYYMMDD" etc for a date field in this column. Refer to <a href="../../references/Date_formats.html">Date formats</a> page for acceptable date formats.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><b>Precision</b> - Precision for a bigdecimal field can be specified here.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Scale</b> - Scale for a bigdecimal field can be specified here.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Scale Type</b> - Scale Type accepts values as implicit or explicit for bigdecimal field and none for other data types. Explicit considers the length of ' <b>.</b> ' and implicit ignores length of ' <b>.</b> ' for the bigdecimal field.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Field Description</b> - User can specify field description.</span></li></ul>
	<li><span><b>External</b> - User can provide an external Hydrograph Schema file of XML format. A text box is provided to either manually type or use the Browse button to select the schema file from File system. The External schema file path is resolved during run time and replaced with the contents of the file in the Job XML.</span></li>
</ul>	

<p>
		<a name="validations"></a><span class="header-2">Validations</span>
	</p>
	<p>
		<span>The Output File Delimited components applies validations to the mandatory fields. Upon placing the 
			Output File Delimited component on job canvas for the first time (from component palette), the component shows up a warning icon as
			mandatory properties are not provided.</span>
	</p>
	<img alt="To be updated" src="../../images/output_Delimited_warning_icon.PNG"  />

	<p>
		<span>The properties window also displays error icon on mandatory fields if it has an incorrect value. The error icon
			is displayed on the tab as well, if any of the field within the tab has some error.</span>
	</p>
	<img alt="To be updated" src="../../images/output_Delimited_property_validation.png" />

	<p>
		<span>If the properties window has some error even after user visit's it once, then the warning icon on the Output File Delimited 
			component on the job canvas changes to error icon. This error icon is removed only when all the mandatory fields are supplied
			with correct values.</span>
