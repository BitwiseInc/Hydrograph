<p><span class="header-1">Input File Mixed Scheme Properties</span></p>

<p><span><b>Properties</b>&nbsp;for the Input File Mixed Scheme component can be viewed by double clicking the component on canvas. The properties contain a &#39;General&#39; tab and a &#39;Schema&#39; tab. Common and mandatory properties are present in the General tab. Schema displays option to accept the field schema i.e. field name, Data type, scale etc. </span></p>

<p><span class="header-2">General Properties:</span></p>

<p><img alt="" src="../../images/Input_File_Mixed_Scheme_Properties_General.png"/></p>

<p><span class="header-2">Display</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><b>Name</b> - The Name field will specify the name of the component as desired by the user.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>ID</b> - ID field will specify unique id for every component. </span></li>
	<li><span><b>Type </b> - Type further categorizes the component to detailed operation that it intends to perform. Here it is of type Input Mixed Scheme.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span class="header-2">Configuration</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><b>File Path</b> - File path is used to specify the path of the input mixed scheme file present either in the File system or on the cluster. User can either manually type the path in the text box provided or use the Browse button to search for the file and select it. Alternatively, the user can parameterize the File path where the parameter value will be resolved at run-time.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Safe Property</b> - This property accepts Boolean values True and False. It can also be parameterized and later on resolved during run-time. The Safe property when True, allows the input fields to pass evaluation despite of Data type mismatch. When False, fields with Data type mismatch will be rejected and the component will abort processing returning an error.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Character Set</b> - Contains a drop-down of character encoding values. Used simply to denote the encoding system followed by the input file to denote characters of data. Drop down lists values like : UTF8, US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1 etc.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Strict</b> - Strict accepts&nbsp;Boolean values True and False. It can also be parameterized and later on resolved during run-time. Strict property is used to check if the record structure i.e. number of fields, length of records, scale etc are exactly listed by the user as in the input file. When set to True, the component fails if the record structure doesn&#39;t match with the one specified by the user. Reverse in case of False.</span></li>
	<li><a name="runtime_properties"></a><span><b>Runtime Properties</b> - Runtime properties are used to override the Hadoop configurations specific to this Aggregate component at run time. User is required to enter the Property Name and Property Value in the runtime properties grid.</span>
	<p><span>Check <a href="../../How To Steps/How_To_Pass_Hadoop_Properties_To_Component.html"> How to pass Hadoop properties to component</a></span></p></li>
</ul>
<ul><p><img alt="" src="../../images/Runtime_Properties_Grid.png" /></p>
	<li><span><b>Batch</b> - Batch simply accepts a numeric number starting from 0 to maximum 99 and signifies the batch this component will execute in. By default this is 0.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="schema"></a><span class="header-2">Schema tab: </span></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/Input_File_Mixed_Scheme_Properties_Schema.png" /></p>
<p><span><b>Schema Types</b></span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span><b>Internal</b> - User is provided a Grid to enter the internal schema of the Input Mixed Scheme file.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Field Name</b> - User needs to enter all the Field names in this column.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Data type</b> - By default "string" Data type has been selected for any field added to the Grid. User can select from different Data type values like "integer", "double", "float" etc.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Length</b> - Length denotes the maximum number of characters that a particular input field may contain. Length field can not remain blank.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Delimiter</b> - The Delimiter field accepts the delimiter that is present in the input file selected. By default the delimiter passed to this component is &#39;|&#39;.User can either specify length or delimiter but not both. Delimiter can be varied for different fields.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Scale</b> - Scale for a bigdecimal field can be specified here.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Scale Type</b> - Scale Type accepts values as implicit or explicit for bigdecimal field and none for other data types. Explicit considers the length of ' <b>.</b> ' and implicit ignores length of ' <b>.</b> ' for the bigdecimal field.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Date Format</b> - For the format of date data type. Refer to <a href="../../references/Date_formats.html">Date formats</a> page for acceptable date formats.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Precision</b> - Precision for a bigdecimal field can be specified here.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Field Description</b> - User can specify field description.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>External</b> - User can provide an external Hydrograph Schema file of XML format. A text box is provided to either manually type or use the Browse button to select the schema file from File system. The External schema file path is resolved during run time and replaced with the contents of the file in the Job XML.</span></li>
</ul>	

<p><a name="validations"></a><span class="header-2">Validations</span></p>
<p><span>The Input File Mixed Scheme components applies validations to the mandatory fields as described above. Upon placing the Input File Mixed Scheme component on job canvas for the first time (from component palette), the component shows up a warning icon as mandatory properties are not provided.</span></p>
<img src="../../images/Input_File_Mixed_Scheme_Canvas.png" alt="Error icon displayed on tabs" />

<p><span>The property window also displays error if any of the property is not placed or described properly. It shows up a warning icon with a message like below in case of the file path (if it contains any character other than underscore or alphanumeric).</span></p>
<img src="../../images/Input_File_Mixed_Scheme_File_Path_Validations_Warning.png" alt="Warning icon displayed on component" />

<p><span> If the user has not provided any value to the Batch field,then also it shows up a message saying "Batch Should not be blank" as shown in the below example.</span></p>
<img src="../../images/Input_File_Mixed_Scheme_Batch_Validation_Error.png" alt="Error icon displayed on component" />

<p><span>If the properties window has some error even after user visits it once, then the warning icon on the Input File Mixed Scheme component on the job canvas changes to error icon. This error icon is removed only when all the mandatory fields are supplied with correct values.</span></p>
