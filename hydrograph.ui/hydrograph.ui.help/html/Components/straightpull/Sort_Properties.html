<p><span class="header-2">Validations</span></p>
<p><span>The Sort components applies validations to the mandatory fields as described above. Upon placing the Sort component on job canvas for the first time (from component palette), the component shows up a warning icon as mandatory properties are not provided.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../../images/Sort_Validation_Warning.png" /></p>
<p><span>The properties window also displays error icon on mandatory fields if it has an incorrect value. The error icon is displayed on the tab as well, if any of the field within the tab has some error.</span></p>
