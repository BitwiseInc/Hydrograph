		<span><b>Properties</b>&nbsp;for the Partition By Expression component can be
			viewed by Double click-&gt;component on canvas. 
		</span>
	</p>
					
	<p>
		<span>The properties contain a &#39;General&#39; tab and a &#39;Schema&#39; tab. 
		Common properties are present in the General tab. 
		Schema tab displays the option to accept the field schema i.e. field name, data type, scale etc.

	<ul>
		<li><span><b>Name</b> - Name is an identifier for the component.
				This is a <b>mandatory</b> property. This property is pre-populated
				with the component name, i.e. 'PartByExp' followed by an incremental
				number. It can be changed to any custom name. The name property has
				following restrictions:</span></li>
		<ul>
			<li><span>Must be specified and should not be blank.</span></li>
			<li><span>Must be unique across the job.</span></li>

					and 4 special characters: "_", "-", ",", " " (space)</span></li>
		</ul>
		<li><span><b>ID</b> - ID signifies unique Id of component. This Id is generated at the time of component creation. This is a non editable field.</span></li>
		<li><span><b>Type </b> - Type further categorizes the
				component to detailed operation that it intends to perform. Here it
				is of type Partition By Expression.This is a non editable field.</span></li>

		<li><span><b>Expression Editor Or Operation Class</b> -
				Edit option of Partition By Expression property window allows user to choose only one
				option,i.e either Expression or Operation.</span>

			<p>
				<span><b>Operation Class</b> : Selecting Operation opens up a
					grid for the user to select for an existing operation class or
					create a new one. The operation class name can be parameterized
					which will be resolved at runtime. Click on <a

<p><img alt="" src="../../images/partition_by_expression_properties_schema.png" /></p>

<p><span>Schema is <b>mandatory</b> for partition by expression component. Schema tab defines the record format on the out port of the partition by expression component. A field in schema has multiple attributes as described below.</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span><b>Field Name</b> - The name for the field. This is a mandatory attribute.</span></li>
	<li><span><b>Data type</b> - The data type for the field. This is a mandatory attribute. The default data type is "String". Check supported data types page for list of supported data types.</span></li>

	<p><span>The Partition By Expression component applies validations to the mandatory fields as described above. Upon placing the Partition By Expression component on job canvas for the first time (from component palette), the component shows up a warning icon as mandatory properties are not provided.</span></p>
		<img src="../../images/partition_by_expression_warning.png" alt="" />
	
	<p>
		<span><b>Validations</b>&nbsp;for the Partition By Expression component are in
			place for each property present on the Properties window.</span>

	</p>
	<p>
		<b>General Properties:</b>
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span><b>Output Partitions</b> - Output Partitions has a default value of 2.
				However, blank text box results in error validation and is not
				allowed.
				<p>
					<img alt="" src="../../images/partition_by_expression_outputpartitions_validation.png" />
				</p> </span></li>
				
		<li><span><b>Operation Class</b> - Operation Class is a
				mandatory field and needs the user to either select a standard
				operation class or create his own custom class. If absent, error for
				empty field appears along with a message on tool tip for the user.
				<p>
					<img alt="" src="../../images/operation_class_validation.png" />
				</p> </span></li>
				
		<li><span><b>Operation Fields </b> -User can select the
				available fields that will be used within the Partition By Expression operation
				class. Hence, known as Operation Fields. Basic validation to check
				empty field values is present on the Operation Fields Grid.
				<p>
					<img alt="" src="../../images/operation_fields_validation.png" />
				</p> </span></li>
				
		<li><span><b>Batch </b> -Batch has a default value of 0.

				</p> </span></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p><span>If the properties window has some error even after user visit's it once, then the warning icon on the Partition By Expression component on the job canvas changes to error icon. This error icon is removed only when all the mandatory fields are supplied with correct values.</span></p>
