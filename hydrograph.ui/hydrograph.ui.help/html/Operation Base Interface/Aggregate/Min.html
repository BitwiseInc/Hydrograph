<p><span>The min function calculates the minimum value for the specified field within the group. This function requires following inputs:</span><p>
<ul>
	<li><p><span>Key fields: The key fields for aggregation. This information is already provided using the <a href="../../Components/transform/Aggregate_Properties.html#key_fields">key fields</a> option on aggregate properties window.</span></p></li>
	<li><p><span>Input field name: The input field whose minimum value within the group is to be found. This information is already provided using the <a href="../../Components/transform/Aggregate_Operation_Editor.html#operation_input_fields">operation input fields</a> option on aggregate operation editor window.</span>
		<p><span><b>Note</b>: Input field supports all comparable data types. All numerical data types as well as date, time, string etc. data types are supported. In case of string, lexicographical comparison is implemented. The comparison is based on the Unicode value of each character in the strings.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li><p><span>Output field name: The field which stores the minimum value of the input field within the group. This information is already provided using the <a href="../../Components/transform/Aggregate_Operation_Editor.html#operation_output_fields">operation output fields</a> option on aggregate operation editor window.</span>
		<p><span><b>Note</b>: The data type of output field is same as that of input field.</span></p>
